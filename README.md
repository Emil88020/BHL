## **Project Details**

**Project Name**: *SpaceHUB*  
**Description**: Our project addresses the problem of mental and physical health of people staying in cosmic space for prolonged periods of time. It uses bot conversational AI model (gpt 4o), text to speech and speech to text models from OpenAI to allow users for more human-like conversations. The model is fed both with informations about CBT therapy, mindfulness, different commonly used therapeutic tools and the reality and scientific data of struggles that astronauts may experience while being on space missions. The future improvements include adding Machine Learning for analyzing personal health and wellbeing data, that would be able to find patterns and give easily applicable recommendations for people staying in space. The future version of app would also collect some of this data, to help companies specializing in space flights create better predictions and allow for more efficient planning and preparation for both scientific and commercial space flights.
